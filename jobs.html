                    <ul>
                        <li>Manage the website. You should know how to make small HTML, JavaScript, and CSS changes to the website bravomath.com.</li>    
                        <li>Manage email services, including “backend” things like MX records and cPanel, creating new accounts, getting it to talk to my gmail inbox, etc.</li>

                    <p>Once you’ve done that, you should be craving more responsibilities (and compensation) and we can talk about education technology, TeX, learning management systems, communication systems, video recording, user testing labs, etc. If you have a real passion for education, that will be a huge plus.</p>

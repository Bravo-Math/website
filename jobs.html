                        Bravo Math is trying to create the best damn math course ever. Your role as the Educational Technology Manager will be to establish a learning management system (LMS) and an online math assessment system. If that goes well, your duties will expand to include creating digital learning resources and activities and conducting informal user tests of them. If/When the business grows, you will manage a formal user testing lab and be offered broader duties generally, with no cap on compensation.

                    <h2>Company & Job Profile</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Bravo Math Inc. is a math education corporation located in Vancouver, Canada. Its owner and current solopreneur, Andrew Uyeno, is transitioning from 1-on-1 tutoring to building a revolutionary math education company.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Bravo Math’s first mission is to get 5000 diverse kids in the Vancouver area enjoying math 5 years above grade-level.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This would be a tremendous breakthrough in the stagnant field of education.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        To achieve this earthquake, Bravo Math is developing the best damn math course ever, <em>Counting to Calculus</em>, a sequence of about 80 lessons so amazing that they transform any student’s life and turn <em>you</em> into an amazing educator. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can help build those lessons and, along the way, learn a ton about education, psychology, math, and even running a business.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Job Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Your main job will be to build “fun hard” lessons for students and open-and-go resources for teachers. When you apply, you will select among the following specific duties.
                        </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be a lead math tutor.</li>    
                        <li>Be a math tutor’s assistant.</li>
                        <li>Create learning activities and lessons according to provided drafts or from scratch. These could be games, videos, worksheets, etc.</li>
                        <li>Find, test, and adapt learning activities.</li>
                        <li>Develop answer keys.</li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing, online and in person.</li>
                        <li>Administrative work (e.g. scheduling, billing, communication with parents, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Programming / Website / IT </li>
                        </ul>
                    
                  </div>
                
                <div class="unit">
                    <h2>Job Qualifications</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to be trained as a tutor, you must sign a waiver agreeing to have your interactions with students video-recorded.</li>
                            <li>You must pass a Vancouver Police Department Police Information Check and be willing and legal to work in Vancouver.</li>
                            <li>You must be fully vaccinated against COVID19.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        Other than that, I do not care at all about your history per se, only that you help Bravo Math's students in the future. Prove you will do that and I'll take you at 9 years old or 90, as grizzled veteran or as your first paying job.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That being said, if you show a passion for education and entrepreneurship, your application will be favored. And since <em>Students First</em> is a core value of Bravo Math, if you're a student, that will also help your application.
                    </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Hours</h2>
                    <p>
                        5 to 10 hours per week to start. 3-4 of those hours will be at fixed weekly times (to be negotiated) and the rest of the time you’ll be picking your own hours. As you prove yourself, there will be <em>plenty</em> more work should you want it. 
                    </p>                 
                    </div>

                  <div class="unit">
                    <h2>Compensation</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are starting approximations as they depend on which responsibilities you assume and how you perform.
                        <br>
                        Initial training wage: $18+/hour
                        <br>
                        Normal wage: $20+/hour
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Merit is a core value of Bravo Math and as your performance improves and your job evolves, there will never be a ceiling on your compensation. Anyone, even inexperienced teenagers, can earn $100+/hour if they persuade me that they’re worth it. And those who don't help students will be shown the door. We'll discuss both possibilities when we first meet.
                    </p>

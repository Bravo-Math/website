        <h1>Math Education Revolutionary Job Profile</h1>
           
        <h2>Company Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
            Help 5000 kids enjoy math 5 years above grade-level.
            
            Detonate an earthquake in the stagnant world of education.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Company Strategy</h2>
        
        <p> Build a sequence of about 60 lessons and materials constituting “Counting to Calculus” and refine it until it’s the best damn math course ever. That means every lesson has to be (1) “fun hard” for students and (2) its resources are “open-and-go” for teachers.

            To accomplish this the company will:
            <ol>
                <li>Focus on bottleneck content only, i.e. grades 1-7 number sense, then narrow slices of each of fractions, algebra, and calculus.</li>
                <li>Rapidly prototype and user-test everything. Video record students as they learn to see what works and what does not for both the learner and teacher.</li>
                <li>Seek evidence that the student hasn't learned deeply, will not retain the information, has worsened work habits, and did not enjoy the lesson. We'll be our own toughest critics.</li>
                <li>Employ the best tactics of cognitive science: active recall, spaced practice, interleaving, elaboration, multiple representations, and concrete examples.</li>
            </ol>          
        
        </p>

        <h2>Company Status</h2>
        
        <p>
            Bravo Math is a fairly new company with two employees. It is transitioning from 1-on-1 tutoring to a plan for <a href="blog.bravomath.com" target="_blank"> global domination</a>.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Job Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
            You will collect, build, test, and iterate resources for “Counting to Calculus” such that they create “fun hard” lessons for students and minimal work for teachers.

                        <li>Work experience of any type. </li>

    <h2>Initial Job Duties & Workflow</h2>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will receive drafts and outlines of materials by email and asked to create digital versions and answer keys.</li>
            <li>You will receive particular learning outcomes and seek, test, create, and collect activities to achieve them.</li>
            <li>You will watch learners use your activities and iterate the resources accordingly.</li>
            <li>In the last 5 or so minutes of each work session, you will report your hours and productivity through a Google Form.</li>
            <li>About once/week, we will meet 1-on-1 to discuss your work.</li>
            <li>Propose new ways to contribute to Bravo Math.</li>
            <li>Create videos and publish videos, some for the next tutor and some for the next student.</li>
        </ol>
    
        Bravo Math is a small and new company. Job duties could change drastically as the mission requires and as you prove you're capable of handling more responsibility. As mentioned above, I expect *you* to propose how this can be done (though I will have ideas as well).
        </p>

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>CA$18/hour to start. As you become better at this job, opportunities for more responsibility and/or raises will arise.           </p>

    <h2>Your Timeline</h2>

    <p>I am not a fan of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_reinventing_the_job_interview" target="_blank">typical job interviews</a>. I want to know how you think and work and there’s little evidence that I or anyone judges this well in job interviews, especially when candidates are young and/or lacking in work experience.</p>

    <p>This is the sequence we will do instead.
    <ol>
        <li>You need to decide that Bravo Math is an opportunity you want to explore. You'll need to read the <a href="blog.bravomath.com" target="_blank">Bravo Math Blog</a>. Feel free to email me (andrew@bravomath.com) about this and I’ll be happy to chat. If you want to work for me, then...</li>
        <li>Complete an application that shows deep thinking about the contents of the blog. If this application and the VPD PIC go well, you will get a $25 eTransfer token payment for the work that went into the application whether or not you get a job offer.</li>
        <li>If I like your application, we'll negotiate a temporary contract of 10 hours or less during which we work together, either simultaneously online or in-person. Assuming that goes well…</li>
        <li>You’ll get assigned 40 hours of mostly autonomous work, to be negotiated. Assuming that goes well…</li>
        <li>We will negotiate a longer-term job contract.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

        <h2>Lesson Developer</h2>
        
        <h3>Company Mission</h3>
        
        <p>
            Help 5000 kids enjoy math 5 years above grade-level.
            Detonate an earthquake in the world of education.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Company Strategy</h3>
        
        <p> Build a sequence of about 60 lessons and materials constituting “Counting to Calculus” and refine it until it’s the best damn math course ever. That means every lesson has to be (1) “fun hard” for students and (2) its resources are “open-and-go” for teachers.

            To accomplish this the company will:
            <ol>
                <li>Focus on bottleneck content only, i.e. grades 1-7 number sense, then narrow slices of each of fractions, algebra, and calculus.</li>
                <li>Rapidly prototype and user-test everything. Video record students as they learn to see what works and what does not for both the learner and teacher.</li>
                <li>Seek evidence that the student hasn’t learned deeply, will not retain the information, has worsened work habits, and did not enjoy the lesson.</li>
                <li>Employ the best tactics of cognitive science: active recall, spaced practice, interleaving, elaboration, multiple representations, and concrete examples.</li>
            </ol>          
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Bravo Math is on a mission to help 5,000 students in Vancouver enjoy math at least five years above grade-level. If you want to join this revolution, you’re in luck, because I'm hiring!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you join this company, you will not only work 1-on-1 with students, but join/start a small team that is employing rapid prototyping, UX, design, and a variety of other tools to create pedagogical breakthroughs. We will ensure that your teaching and your lessons get better and better every day until you are a master educator, and, you too, can train other tutors.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need no experience in education or working with children, though you must pass a <a href="https://vancouver.ca/police/organization/records-checks-fingerprinting/index.html" target="_blank">Vancouver Police Information Check</a> because you will be working with minors. You’ll also need enthusiasm, patience, and an open-mind. Everything else is trainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay: $15/h for observation and training, $17.50/ for supervised tutoring, $20/ for unsupervised tutoring.
        </p>

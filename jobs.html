                    <p> Are you interested in using your computer skills in a small education company trying to change the world? If so, Bravo Math is looking for an IT manager to manage basic website (bravomath.com) needs and email functions, then, if that goes well, help the business expand with learning management systems, communication systems, social media, etc. <a href="https://forms.gle/UnB6iXNRWmSMinyE6" target="_blank" class="apply_now"> Apply Now</a> or read on!

                    <h2>Job Responsibilities & Qualifications</h2>
                    <p>Initial job duties will be to fix and streamline my website and email settings so that they “just work”. You will have to:
                        </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manage the website. You should know how to make small HTML, JavaScript, and CSS changes to the website bravomath.com.</li>    
                        <li>Manage email services, including “backend” things like MX records and cPanel, creating new accounts, getting it to talk to my gmail inbox, etc.</li>
                        <li>Prevent and respond to these kinds of errors.</li>
                        <li>Establish basic protocols for IT security and backups.</li>
                        <li>Help write part of the Bravo Math Operations Manual for IT. [This will allow you to systematize your work and qualify for more responsibilities and pay down the road.]</li>
                        <li>Work without supervision while tracking your hours and results.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>Once you’ve done that, you should be craving more responsibilities (and compensation) and we can talk about education technology, TeX, learning management systems, communication systems, video recording, user testing labs, etc. If you have a real passion for education, that will be a huge plus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Also required: To show you have growth potential in the company, you must be able to work in the Vancouver area.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bonus: <em>Students First</em> is the first and most important core value of Bravo Math. If you prove you are currently a part-time or full-time student, your application will be favored.</p>

                    <h2>Hours & Compensation</h2>
                    <p>Hours: For the initial duties above, you can work whichever hours you want as long as the company's IT systems "just work". :-)</p>
                    <p>Compensation: Commensurate with your experience and competitive with industry norms. We will negotiate something that works for both of us.</p>

                    <p> 
                        Bravo Math Inc. is a math education corporation located in Vancouver, Canada. Its owner and current solopreneur, Andrew Uyeno, is transitioning from 1-on-1 tutoring to building a revolutionary math education company.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Bravo Math’s first mission is to get 5000 diverse kids in the Vancouver area enjoying math 5 years above grade-level.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This would be a tremendous breakthrough in the stagnant field of education.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        To achieve this earthquake, Bravo Math is developing the best damn math course ever, <em>Counting to Calculus</em>, a sequence of about 80 lessons so amazing that they transform any student’s life and turn <em>you</em> into an amazing educator. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can help build those lessons and, along the way, learn a ton about education, psychology, math, and even running a business.

                    <h2>Job Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Your main job will be to build “fun hard” lessons for students and open-and-go resources for teachers. When you apply, you will select among the following specific duties.
                        </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be a lead math tutor.</li>    
                        <li>Be a math tutor’s assistant.</li>
                        <li>Create learning activities and lessons according to provided drafts or from scratch. These could be games, videos, worksheets, etc.</li>
                        <li>Find, test, and adapt learning activities.</li>
                        <li>Develop answer keys.</li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing, online and in person.</li>
                        <li>Administrative work (e.g. scheduling, billing, communication with parents, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Programming / Website / IT </li>
                        </ul>
                    
                  </div>
                
                <div class="unit">
                    <h2>Job Qualifications</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to be trained as a tutor, you must sign a waiver agreeing to have your interactions with students video-recorded.</li>
                            <li>You must pass a Vancouver Police Department Police Information Check and be willing and legal to work in Vancouver.</li>
                            <li>You must be fully vaccinated against COVID19.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        Other than that, I do not care at all about your history per se, only that you help Bravo Math's students in the future. Prove you will do that and I'll take you at 9 years old or 90, as grizzled veteran or as your first paying job.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That being said, if you show a passion for education and entrepreneurship, your application will be favored. And since <em>Students First</em> is a core value of Bravo Math, if you're a student, that will also help your application.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="unit">
                    <h2>Hours</h2>
                    <p>
                        5 to 10 hours per week to start. 3-4 of those hours will be at fixed weekly times (to be negotiated) and the rest of the time you’ll be picking your own hours. As you prove yourself, there will be <em>plenty</em> more work should you want it. 
                    </p>                 
                    </div>

                  <div class="unit">
                    <h2>Compensation</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are starting approximations as they depend on which responsibilities you assume and how you perform.
                        <br>
                        Initial training wage: $18+/hour
                        <br>
                        Normal wage: $20+/hour
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Merit is a core value of Bravo Math and as your performance improves and your job evolves, there will never be a ceiling on your compensation. Anyone, even inexperienced teenagers, can earn $100+/hour if they persuade me that they’re worth it. And those who don't help students will be shown the door. We'll discuss both possibilities when we first meet.
                    </p>

        <h1>Apply to be a Math Education Revolutionary!</h1>
                      
        <p>
            Do you want a join a math education startup in Vancouver aiming to help 5000 kids enjoy math 5 years above grade-level?

            Bravo Math is that startup.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Mission of the Math Education Revolutionary</h2>
        
        <p>
            Bravo Math is building a course called "Counting to Calculus", which will be a sequence of about 60 lessons and resources designed to convert mathphobes into calculus-lovers and graduates into amazing peer tutors. You will help build those resources so that the lessons are “fun hard” for students and minimal work for teachers.
        </p>
      
    <br>  
    <h2>Initial Job Duties & Workflow</h2>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will receive drafts and outlines of math education resources and asked to create digital versions and answer keys.</li>
            <li>You will receive particular learning outcomes and seek, test, create, and collect activities to achieve them.</li>
            <li>You will watch learners use your activities and iterate the resources accordingly.</li>
            <li>In the last 5 or so minutes of each work session, you will report your hours and productivity through a Google Form.</li>
            <li>About once/week, we will meet 1-on-1 to discuss your work.</li>
            <li>Propose new ways to contribute to Bravo Math.</li>
            <li>Create videos and publish videos, some for the next tutor and some for the next student.</li>
        </ol>
    
        Bravo Math is a small and new company. Job duties will change to meet the needs of students. I'll be favoring applicants who can grow with the business.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2>Applicant Requirements</h2>
        
        <p>

            <li>Desire to work with kids and/or the education field.</li>
            <li>Excited for the uncertainty of a new business, excited to build something from nothing. I cannot, for example, tell you with certainty when or where or with whom you will work. Your job duties could change dramatically.</li>
            <li>Outgoing and enthusiastic personality, the kind that kids gravitate towards, that can celebrate their progress.</li>
            <li>Willingness to learn and self-examine. Ability to speak painful but important truths tactfully.</li>
            <li>Can work autonomously and follow instructions. Determination and resourcefulness.</li>
            <li>Culture and value compatibility. [See <a href ="https://blog.bravomath.com/wp/2021/07/09/6-the-bravo-math-culture-deck/" target="_blank"> Bravo Math Culture Deck</a>.]</li>
            <li>If you want to work with students in-person, you must be able to get around the Vancouver area.</li>
            <li>If you want to be trained as a tutor, you must sign a waiver agreeing to have your interactions with students video-recorded.</li>
            </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>NOT Applicant Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>Significant math skill. As long as you can count fluently and accurately within 100, you can still join this company as an activity-tester. I will value your ability to empathize with struggling learners!</li>

        <li>Good grades in school.</li>

        </p>
    
    <br>
    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>CA$18/hour to start. As you become better at this job, I expect you to propose taking on more responsibility for more pay.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h2>Your Timeline</h2>

    <p>I am not a fan of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_reinventing_the_job_interview" target="_blank">typical job interviews</a>.</p>

    <p>This is what will happen instead.
    <ol>
        <li>Read the <a href="blog.bravomath.com" target="_blank">Bravo Math Blog</a>. Decide if you want to learn more and get involved. Feel free to email me (andrew@bravomath.com) about this and I’ll be happy to chat. If you want to work here, then...</li>
        <li>Complete an application (link below). All thoughtful applicants will receive an email response and a token $25 eTransfer payment whether or not a job offer results.</li>
        <li>If your application signals a good fit, we'll meet in-person to negotiate a temporary contract.</li>
        <li>When that's over, we'll decide on a longer-term deal.</li>
    </ol>

        <h1>Job Opening: Curriculum Developer + </h1>
        
        <h2>Company Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
            Help 5000 kids enjoy math 5 years above grade-level.
            Detonate an earthquake in the world of education.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Company Strategy</h2>
        
        <p> Build a sequence of about 60 lessons and materials constituting “Counting to Calculus” and refine it until it’s the best damn math course ever. That means every lesson has to be (1) “fun hard” for students and (2) its resources are “open-and-go” for teachers.

            To accomplish this the company will:
            <ol>
                <li>Focus on bottleneck content only, i.e. grades 1-7 number sense, then narrow slices of each of fractions, algebra, and calculus.</li>
                <li>Rapidly prototype and user-test everything. Video record students as they learn to see what works and what does not for both the learner and teacher.</li>
                <li>Seek evidence that the student hasn’t learned deeply, will not retain the information, has worsened work habits, and did not enjoy the lesson.</li>
                <li>Employ the best tactics of cognitive science: active recall, spaced practice, interleaving, elaboration, multiple representations, and concrete examples.</li>
            </ol>          
        
        </p>

        <h2>Company Status</h2>
        
        <p>
            Bravo Math is a fairly new company with two employees. It is transitioning from 1-on-1 tutoring to a plan for <a href="blog.bravomath.com" target="_blank"> global domination</a>.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Job Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
            You will collect, build, test, and iterate resources for “Counting to Calculus” such that they create “fun hard” lessons for students and minimal work for teachers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Job Requirements</h2>
    
        <p>
            <table style ="width:100%">
                
                <tr>

                        <li>Will pass a Vancouver Police Department Information Check</li>
                        <li>Desire to work with kids and/or the education field.</li>
                        <li>Excited for the uncertainty of a new business, excited to build something from nothing. I cannot, for example, tell you with certainty when or where or with whom you will work. Your job duties could change dramatically.</li>
                        <li>Outgoing and enthusiastic personality, the kind that kids gravitate towards, that can celebrate their progress.</li>
                        <li>Willingness to learn and self-examine. Ability to speak painful but important truths tactfully.</li>
                        <li>Can work autonomously and follow instructions. Determination and resourcefulness.</li>
                        <li>Culture and value compatibility. [See <a href ="https://blog.bravomath.com/wp/2021/07/09/6-the-bravo-math-culture-deck/" target="_blank"> Bravo Math Culture Deck</a>.]</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ol>
                </tr>
                
                </table>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If you join this company, you will not only work 1-on-1 with students, but join/start a small team that is employing rapid prototyping, UX, design, and a variety of other tools to create pedagogical breakthroughs. We will ensure that your teaching and your lessons get better and better every day until you are a master educator, and, you too, can train other tutors.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need no experience in education or working with children, though you must pass a <a href="https://vancouver.ca/police/organization/records-checks-fingerprinting/index.html" target="_blank">Vancouver Police Information Check</a> because you will be working with minors. You’ll also need enthusiasm, patience, and an open-mind. Everything else is trainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay: $15/h for observation and training, $17.50/ for supervised tutoring, $20/ for unsupervised tutoring.

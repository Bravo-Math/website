                       Are you interested in using your computer skills in a small education company trying to change the world? Bravo Math is looking for a part-time (5 or so hours per month) IT Manager in the Vancouver area to fix and build basic website (bravomath.com), email, and blog systems. [No fancy features or functions. They just need to work.] Following success in that area, you will increase the capacity of the business to meet demand through learning management systems, paperless assessment, custom software-based math education software, accounting systems, and other educational technology. As you help the business grow, you will change lives, and your compensation will grow accordingly.

                    <p> 
                        Bravo Math Inc. is a math education corporation located in Vancouver, Canada. Its owner and current solopreneur, Andrew Uyeno, is transitioning from 1-on-1 tutoring to building a revolutionary math education company.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Bravo Math’s first mission is to get 5000 diverse kids in the Vancouver area enjoying math 5 years above grade-level.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This would be a tremendous breakthrough in the stagnant field of education.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        To achieve this earthquake, Bravo Math is developing the best damn math course ever, <em>Counting to Calculus</em>, a sequence of about 80 lessons so amazing that they transform any student’s life and turn <em>you</em> into an amazing educator. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can help build those lessons and, along the way, learn a ton about education, psychology, math, and even running a business.

                    <h2>Job Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>Your main job will be to build “fun hard” lessons for students and open-and-go resources for teachers. When you apply, you will select among the following specific duties.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Job Qualifications</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to be trained as a tutor, you must sign a waiver agreeing to have your interactions with students video-recorded.</li>
                            <li>You must pass a Vancouver Police Department Police Information Check and be willing and legal to work in Vancouver.</li>
                            <li>You must be fully vaccinated against COVID19.</li>

                    <p>
                        Other than that, I do not care at all about your history per se, only that you help Bravo Math's students in the future. Prove you will do that and I'll take you at 9 years old or 90, as grizzled veteran or as your first paying job.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That being said, if you show a passion for education and entrepreneurship, your application will be favored. And since <em>Students First</em> is a core value of Bravo Math, if you're a student, that will also help your application.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Hours</h2>
                    <p>
                        5 to 10 hours per week to start. 3-4 of those hours will be at fixed weekly times (to be negotiated) and the rest of the time you’ll be picking your own hours. As you prove yourself, there will be <em>plenty</em> more work should you want it. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Compensation</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are starting approximations as they depend on which responsibilities you assume and how you perform.
                        <br>
                        Initial training wage: $18+/hour
                        <br>
                        Normal wage: $20+/hour
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Merit is a core value of Bravo Math and as your performance improves and your job evolves, there will never be a ceiling on your compensation. Anyone, even inexperienced teenagers, can earn $100+/hour if they persuade me that they’re worth it. And those who don't help students will be shown the door. We'll discuss both possibilities when we first meet.

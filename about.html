                <div class="panel">

            	<p>Hi! I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC. I graduated from McGill with Bachelor of Commerce, Honours Economics, minor in Psychology, 2006. The economics program was math-based and the psychology minor sparked a fascination with how people learn.</p>

           		 <p>My passion in life is teaching math, especially to those who really struggle with it or even hate it. That’s what I’ve been doing since January, 2010. Much of my work has been with students of King David High School. My success and popularity with their students led to the principal hiring me as a Special Education Assistant from September 2012 to June 2014.</p>

            	<p>In addition to tutoring, I am now on a mission to create the best damn math lessons ever made, so good that they shake up the super stagnant field of education. Read more at the <a href="https://blog.bravomath.com/wp/" target="_blank">Bravo Math Blog</a>.</p>

                    <p>Yes! As of October 2018, I passed the <a href="/images/record-check.png" target="_blank">BC Ministry of Justice background check</a> to volunteer at Tupper Secondary. In November 2018, I obtained this <a href="images/record-check2.pdf" target="_blank">Vancouver Police Department Information Check</a> to work at St Patrick's Secondary.</p>

                    <p>Location: <br> Though in flux, after calling the BC CDC about COVID19 adjustments, my plans as of now (Aug 7) are to offer in-home services only to students in grade 7 or younger and their siblings whom I can meet during the same visit. The days I select for this will depend on demand. All other tutoring will continue on Zoom or possibly at a tutoring location where I can systematically control spacing, ventilation, air filters, sanitation, etc.</p>

                    <p>Time: <br>I'm making major changes this year to my schedule, which will largely depend on demand, but, rest assured, math education is my full time job.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>As the month turns over, I get in touch with all my students and parents to confirm billing and a schedule for the month ahead. Note: As explained below, to get the lower rate you must book and pay for the month’s sessions in advance. My schedule is generally full so <b>I am rarely available at the last minute and I do not offer flexible scheduling.</b> If you need any adjustments in terms of time or sessions, let me know as soon as possible. (Also, see cancellation policy below.)</p>

                    <p><a href="/research+jobs.html" target="_blank">Yes.</a> Though I love tutoring, the real plan all along has been to prove that it is, in fact, possible to radically improve the field of education. For Sept 2020 - Aug 2021, I will emphasize the productization of my lessons, which I hope proves this. As the new initiative gains traction, I will be cutting my hours for 1-on-1 tutoring accordingly. That being said, I will, of course, make every effort to continue to work with the families I’ve worked with in the past. I will allocate my tutoring hours by “seniority” of the families I’ve worked with.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I grant each student one last-minute cancellation or no-show, after which <b>I charge in full for all sessions booked</b>, except in cases of family emergency, illness, or extreme weather. Since I also offer the first session for free, this is a fairly generous policy. If you need to make adjustments to a schedule, the end-of-month correspondence is the time to do it.</p>

                    <p>No. This is a good since I would probably test at a grade 2-ish level in most other subjects. I can, though, help students organize their “math lives” which can give them the experience of being truly organized. <img class="icon" src="images/cat.png"></p>

                    <p>
                        I see tremendous potential in every learner if they’re willing to work up from where they’re at, regardless of what’s going on in school. I also know how to squander that potential: rote cramming for meaningless grades while hoping things will change for the better in the future. When students and parents say something to the effect of:

                        <p><i>I don't care if I can count past 10 or not. Teach me 2800÷50=___ NOW because that's what my test is on tomorrow.</i></p>

                    <p>
                        This is obviously stupid and harmful and I will not partake. If this characterizes what you want - and many students and parents do as soon as there's an imminent test or deadline - then I will refer you to another tutoring service. I'd also include a warning: The math situation will only get worse because this approach only adds to the root cause of the problem. So don’t blame me when you realize who has paved their own road to Math Hell.

            <section>
                <div class="toggler">Really? Cramming paves the road to Math Hell?</div>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yes. Really. No personal trainer has ever heard a client say:

                        <p>
                        <i>“I don’t care if I can only lift 50kg now! I want to learn how to lift 150kg today! I have a schedule to keep!”</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        This kind of dangerous lunacy doesn’t happen in weight lifting, but it is quite common in math, because many kids cram and memorize their way through tests for years, "earning" good grades, but never really being assessed on conceptual mastery or retention. Eventually, they need to build on those missing concepts, at which point math is hell and they can't get out because of disastrously entrenched study habits, a twisted view of math, and years of missing knowledge.

                    <p>And chances are, I’ll be happy to help you. But some students in grades 11 and 12 have, for years, passed their math classes by rote memorizing and cramming, not understanding. If you’ve been doing that and plan to continue, I will refer you to another tutoring service.

            	<p>Hi! I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC. I graduated from McGill with a Bachelor of Commerce, Honours Economics, minor in Psychology, 2006. The economics program was math-based and the psychology minor sparked a fascination with how people learn.</p>

           		 <p>My passion in life is teaching math, especially to those who really struggle with it or even hate it. That’s what I’ve been doing since January, 2010. Much of my work has been with students of King David High School. My success and popularity with their students led to the principal hiring me as a Special Education Assistant from September 2012 to June 2014.</p>

            	<p>In addition to tutoring, I am now on a mission to create the best damn math lessons ever made, so good that they shake up the super stagnant field of education. Read more at the <a href="https://blog.bravomath.com/wp/" target="_blank">Bravo Math Blog</a>.</p>

                    <p>Bravo Math offers in-person and online lessons in and around Vancouver. In-person tutoring is only for students who are showing no <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/more/health-features/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/symptoms-covid" target="_blank">symptoms of COVID</a>.
